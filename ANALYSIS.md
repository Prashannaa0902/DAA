// In the given case 
                
                PRIMS:
                
                  The shortest path using Prims algorithm will work as the first case will itself be the best case in finding the shortest path at the minimal cost.
 The minimum cost acheived using prim's algorithm is 8. The code and the output of the same is attached.
